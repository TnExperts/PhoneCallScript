### Required Program

* .NET Core for [Mac](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos), [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowscmd), or [Linux](ttps://www.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxredhat)

### Optional

* [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Run

Fill out empty info in the .cs file. 
Run:
```
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
Hold escape to clean exit after a batch of calls.

Note: `dotnet restore` is what downloads the libraries and only needs to be run once when you first download the repo. `dotnet run` is the actually command that starts the program.

## Info

I decided to slap this on here because I saw [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzedMdx6QG4) but saw no published code. As far as I can tell, this is basically it. I slightly modified it to work with my environment / sense of humor. I also added a few comments along the way. I consider this a C# learning project for me. Please use responsibly.
